# ZORA_TRADE_TOP_LOG.md

This file documents the conversation and implementation of the Zora coin trading and top coins listing feature.

## Initial Request

**User Prompt:** 
> great, now can i add a new page to the vite app that lists the top zora coins and allows users to buy 0.01 ETH of each of those coins using the SDK?

**Context:** Building upon the existing Zora Coin Creator app to add coin discovery and trading functionality.

## Research and Planning Phase

### Zora SDK API Research
- **WebSearch**: Searched for @zoralabs/coins-sdk query and trading functionality
- **WebFetch**: Retrieved information from docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/queries/explore about coin listing APIs
- **WebFetch**: Retrieved trading documentation from docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/trade-coin

### Key Research Findings

#### Coin Query Functions Available:
- `getCoinsTopGainers`: Retrieves coins with highest market cap increase in 24 hours
- `getCoinsTopVolume24h`: Finds coins with highest trading volume in 24 hours
- `getCoinsMostValuable`: Lists coins with highest market capitalization
- `getCoinsNew`: Shows most recently created coins
- `getCoinsLastTraded`: Displays most recently traded coins
- `getCoinsLastTradedUnique`: Shows coins traded by unique traders

#### Trading Functionality:
- `tradeCoin` function enables trading between ETH and ERC20 tokens
- Supports creator coins and content coins
- Includes permit-based approvals and slippage protection
- Currently supports Base mainnet only

#### Trading Implementation Example:
```typescript
const tradeParameters = {
  sell: { type: "eth" },
  buy: {
    type: "erc20",
    address: "0x4e93a01c90f812284f71291a8d1415a904957156",
  },
  amountIn: parseEther("0.001"),
  slippage: 0.05,
  sender: account.address,
};

const receipt = await tradeCoin({
  tradeParameters,
  walletClient,
  account,
  publicClient,
});
```

6. **State Management**: Proper loading, error, and success state handling

## Testing Status

**Development Server Issue**: 
- Same crypto.hash compatibility issue with Vite 7 and Node.js v20
- Requires Node.js v22+ for proper operation
- All implementation completed and ready for testing

## Final Implementation State

The application successfully extends the original coin creation functionality with:

- ✅ Multi-page navigation with React Router
